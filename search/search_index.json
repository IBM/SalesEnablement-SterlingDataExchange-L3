The goal of this demonstration guide is to provide IBM and Business Partner technical sellers with the knowledge and tools to perform hands-on demonstrations of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator. READ THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING To complete this activity, users MUST have an entitlement key in the IBM Entitled Registry to access IBM container software (e.g. IBM Sterling B2B Integrator). Before proceeding, verify an entitlement exists. To verify entitlement to IBM container software, open the IBM Entitlement key page here . Note, authentication to ibm.com will be required. If a screen with a yellow warning as seen in the image below is displayed, you will NOT be able to complete this activity. IBM employees will need to open a IBM Cloud support ticket to request access. Business Partners can learn more about their entitlements here , and will need to speak with their IBM representative to resolve the entitlement issue. If a valid entitlement exists, a screen similar to the one below should be displayed. The actual key will be created in a later step. lease proceed with the demonstration script. In addition to completing all the steps in this demonstration guide, to obtain the associated IBM Sterling Data Exchange Level 3 badge: IBM Technical Sellers must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate delivery of a \u201clive\u201d demo in front of a client \u2014 on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points the client has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller\u2019s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client the value of the IBM solution using the environment and techniques of this lab. Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recordings is provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course in Your Learning. Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing this demonstration guide. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. The quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and not general knowledge of the offering. Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active while completing the quiz. Watch for the \"BP quiz question\" icon in the demonstration guide.

In this demonstration, the FileZilla application will be used. FileZilla is a free and open-source, cross-platform FTP application, consisting of FileZilla Client and FileZilla Server. Clients are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS. Learn more about FileZilla here . If users do not already have FileZilla installed, do so now. IBM employees can download FileZilla from the Mac@IBM store. For Business Partners and IBMers on Microsoft Windows, the download links are available at the link above. If users are unable to use FileZilla, it is recommended to use the IBM Sterling File Gateway clients for both users in the scenario that follows. To avoid having to log in and out between user actions, it is recommended to use two different browsers (e.g. Chrome and Firefox) for each user or private/incognito windows for each user when accessing the IBM Sterling File Gateways. When doing a client demonstration, it is recommended to split the FileZilla and browser windows on the same screen to avoid switching back and forth during the demonstration. For this scenario, partner1 will use the IBM Sterling File Gateway clients, and partner2 will use FileZilla. As an introduction, watch this brief video of the steps to be performed. Configure FileZilla for partner2 To configure FileZilla for partner2 both the File Gateway route address and port number will be needed. Return to the OpenShift web console and click on the sterling-fg-b2bi-asi-internal-route route on the Routes page. Select the Host field, right click, and click Copy . Note, the example below was captured using Firefox on MacOS. Others browser menus options may be labeled differently. Open the FileZilla application on local computer. Click the FileZilla Site Manager icon. Click the New site button. Enter B2BGateway for the New Site name and press enter. Select SFTP - Secure File Transfer Protocol on the Protocol pull-down menu. Paste the route copied in step 2 into the Host field. Enter the port number of the sterling-fg-b2bi-asi-backend-svc service in the Port field. Don't remember the port number? The port number can be found in the details of the sterling-fg-b2bi-asi-backend-svc service in the OpenShift web console - use adapters-1's Node port . Enter partner2 in the User field and password in the Password field and click the Connect button. Check the Always trust this host, add this key to cache checkbox and click OK on the Unknown host key pop-up window. Notice the connection is established and the Remote site shows no files. At this time, it is recommended to have both FileZilla and the OpenShift web console both visible at the same time (either split on a single screen or using multiple monitors). Create or download the 2 sample files that will be transferred between partner1 and partner2. Since the templates created earlier allow for any file names to be transferred it does not matter what files are used. It is suggested to use small files so the transfers happen quickly. Feel free to download these two sample invoice files. In most browsers, select the link names below, right click on the links, and click Save link as to the local Downloads directory.

At this point, all users should have completed the steps in the IBM Sterling Data Exchange Level 3 learning plan to reserve the Red Hat OpenShift environment as described in the IBM Sterling Data Exchange Level 3 Introduction video . Before proceeding, validate that the reservation has been fully provisioned and is in the Ready state in ITZ. If not, please complete those steps before proceeding. The following steps must be performed before delivering the demonstration. These steps should be performed well in advance of starting an actual client demonstration as it will take approximately 90 minutes for all steps to complete. Access the OpenShift web console and verify the OpenShift cluster's health From the ITZ My Reservations page , click the tile for your OpenShift cluster reservation (must be in the Ready state). At this time, make note of the Username and Password fields under the Shared Reservation heading as highlighted above. You will need these values in the next steps. Click the Open your IBM Cloud environment button on the reservations detail page. A new window or tab will open in your browser. Enter the Username and Password for your OpenShift cluster (as described in step 1 above) and click the Log in button. Before proceeding, verify that all 3 worker nodes were properly provisioned and available. Click the Compute menu option in left-hand menu bar and then click the Nodes menu option. Observe the Nodes that have the role of worker . There should be 3 of them with a status of Ready . Are less than 3 worker nodes available and Ready **? If there are less than 3 worker nodes in the Ready state, it is very likely you will encounter issues during the installation of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator. It is highly recommended to delete the current ITZ reservation and create a new one following the earlier instructions. Alternatively, you can open a ticket with the ITZ support team using the #itz-techzone-support slack channel and see if the support team can fix the broken node(s). Access the Bastion server for the ITZ environment In the next steps, you will access a virtual machine running in IBM Cloud referred to as a Bastion server. This server will be used to run various IBM Cloud, OpenShift, and other command line interfaces to install IBM Sterling B2B Integrator on the OpenShift cluster. To access the Bastion server, you must create a remote shell from your local workstation to the Bastion using a secure shell protocol client (ssh). Most operating systems (MacOS, Linux, Microsoft Windows) have an ssh client built in. There are also 3rd party and open source clients like putty that can be utilized. The screen images that follow utilize the native MacOS ssh client running from a terminal window. Specific instructions for other operating systems are not provided, but should be similar. Copy the Bastion SSH connection string for your ITZ reservation details page. At this time, make note of the Bastion Password field as highlighted above. You will need this password in the next step. Open a terminal or command line window on your local workstation. In your local terminal or command line window, paste the Bastion SSH connection string and press enter. If prompted to accept the fingerprint, enter yes Enter the Bastion Password when prompted for a password.

At this point, all users should have completed the steps in the IBM Sterling Data Exchange Level 3 learning plan to reserve the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud environment as described in the IBM Sterling Data Exchange Level 3 Introduction video . Before proceeding, validate that the reservation has been fully provisioned and is in the Ready state in ITZ. If not, please complete those steps before proceeding. The following steps must be performed before delivering the demonstration. These steps should be performed well in advance of starting an actual client demonstration as it will take approximately 90 minutes for all steps to complete. Accept invitation to join the ITZ IBM Cloud account for the Custom ROKS reservation Open the You are invited to join an account in IBM Cloud email received from IBM Cloud and click the Join now link. Did not get an e-mail from IBM Cloud? If you did not receive an e-mail from IBM Cloud inviting you to join the 2112072 - ITZ - V2, but you did receive a notification from ITZ that your environment was ready, try the following: Log into cloud.ibm.com using your IBM Cloud ID. Click the . Look for a new notification with the subject: Action required: You are invited to join an account in IBM Cloud . Click on the notification and then click the Join now link. If you do not see a notification or an e-mail, try deleting the existing reservation in ITZ and try creating a new one. If that doesn't work, open a support ticket in the #itz-techzone-support Slack channel. Include the reservation ID and summarize the problem in your message. In the browser window that opens, click the Join Account button. Follow the steps to login to IBM Cloud. On the IBM Cloud Dashboard set the current account to 2112072 - ITZ - V2 . Not seeing 2112072 - ITZ - V2? It is possible ITZ provisioned the OpenShift cluster in a different IBM Cloud account. Select the account specified in the ITZ reservation. Access the OpenShift web console Click the OpenShift icon in the left-hand menu bar. Click Clusters . Click the OpenShift cluster name in the table. Note: the cluster name will be different than seen in the above image. Click the OpenShift web console button. At this time, a page like the one below should open in a new browser window or tab. Leave this browser window open. It will be used again later. Retrieve the B2Bi installation scripts In this part of the demonstration, you will use the IBM Cloud Shell. If you are not familiar with IBM Cloud Shell, you can learn about it here . Warning It is critical all steps in this section be completed in a single instance of IBM Cloud Shell. If the shell becomes inactive for more than 20 minutes, it will be closed. Additionally, local files will not persist after 2 hours of inactivity. In this section, files are downloaded, modified, and long running commands are executed. Please allot approximately 90 continuous minutes to complete this section of the demonstration script. Note, the last step is a long running (~60 minutes) automated script. Once started, keep the Cloud Shell browser window/tab open and allow the process to complete. No further user interaction will be required once it is started. Not completing this section in a single instance of IBM Cloud Shell will leave the B2Bi deployment to OpenShift in an inconsistent state. A new ITZ environment will need to be provisioned and this section will need to be re-executed. Tip Use the copy capability of the demonstration guide to copy and paste commands to the IBM Cloud Command Shell to avoid typing errors. In the IBM Cloud Portal, with the demonstration account selected ( 2112072 - ITZ - V2 ), click the IBM Cloud Shell icon. The IBM Cloud Shell will open in a new browser tab or window. It may take a few seconds for the shell to initialize.

Learn an interesting detail about IBM Cloud Shell while you wait... IBM Cloud Shell is a very useful tool when working with IBM Cloud command line interfaces as well as other Cloud-related tools like Red Hat OpenShift, kubernetes, helm, etc. as many of these tools are preinstalled and alleviate the need to install tools on personal workstations. However, IBM Cloud Shell has some limitations that you can read about here . One additional limitation not listed in the above doc is that IBM Cloud Shell will kill long running processes running in scripts (e.g. bash scripts). This issue was encountered while creating these installation scripts. Originally, steps 37 through 39 above were contained in the deploy_b2bi.sh script. However, when executed, the deploy_b2bi.sh script would get killed (which in turn killed helm) after running approximately 20 minutes. By pulling the helm command out of the script and running it directly in the initial shell process, helm is able to complete the install of the B2Bi containers. Example output ...

Before proceeding, it is highly encouraged that users complete the IBM Sterling Data Exchange Level 2 learning plan. The plan is accessible to IBM employees here and Business Partners here . Before proceeding, take 10 minutes to listen to Tom Limanek, B2B subject matter expert, explain the full scope of IBM B2B Integrator and the history of all the standards it supports. In this demonstration script, a secure partner-to-partner data exchange solution is created using IBM Sterling Business to Business Integrator (B2Bi). More specifically, this demonstration solution uses the IBM Certified Containers for IBM Sterling B2B Integrator version of B2Bi. This version provides enterprise-grade and security-rich product editions with integrated common software services for consistent-deployment lifecycle management, including easy install and configure options, management of upgrade and roll-back, scalability, and security. Learn more about B2Bi here and access the B2Bi product documentation here . This demonstration solution uses Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to allow two partners to exchange files in a secure manner. To create this demonstration solution, the containerized version of B2Bi will be deployed to a Red Hat OpenShift Cluster in IBM Technology Zone. This demonstration script consists of 3 installation and configuration chapters and a chapter describing a client demonstration scenario. It is now time to install B2Bi on a Red Hat OpenShift cluster.","title":"Demonstration Overview"}]}
