{{offering.name}} (PEM) is a software based engagement system that enables faster onboarding, collaboration, interaction, monitoring, management, and visibility into the interactions between companies and their partners, customers, and suppliers. PEM significantly reduces the time and resources required to onboard new partners while enhancing the ability to manage
