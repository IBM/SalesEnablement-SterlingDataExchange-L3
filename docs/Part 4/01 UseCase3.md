This use case involves setting up a SFTP connection for a partner.  By the end of the activity, you will have a partner that has completed and validated their connectivity setup and will be ready to start trading with the sponsor.
While PEM Standard supports AS2, Connect:Direct, FTP, FTPS, and SFTP protocols, for purposes of demonstrations, we will focus on the SFTP onboarding protocol along with AS2 as these are the two most dominant protocols most requested by our customers.
This onboarding flow with demonstrate the combined efforts of the trading partners, business users, and IT teams to collaborate and automate the onboarding of trading partners to the MFT platform. In addition to configuring the protocols, the flows will provide options to either push/pull files to and from partners' servers or provide the capability for partners to push/pull files to and from the sponsor.
