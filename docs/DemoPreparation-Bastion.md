This demonstration guide assumes a Red Hat OpenShift cluster running on VMware on IBM Cloud environment provisioned in IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/63dba359cc19150018af084f" target="_blank">here</a>.

At this point, all users should have completed the steps in the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan to reserve the Red Hat OpenShift environment as described in the {{learningplan.name}} <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC8JQcd2PWDTR8fB2FmjmV3cPC8P" target="_blank">Introduction video</a>. Before proceeding, validate that the reservation has been fully provisioned and is in the **Ready** state in ITZ. If not, please complete those steps before proceeding.

The following steps must be performed before delivering the demonstration. These steps should be performed well in advance of starting an actual client demonstration as it will take approximately **90 minutes** for all steps to complete.

## Access the OpenShift web console and verify the OpenShift cluster's health

1. From the <a href="http:https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations" target="_blank">ITZ My Reservations page</a>, click the tile for your OpenShift cluster reservation (must be in the **Ready** state).

![](_attachments/ITZReservationDetailsPage.png)

At this time, make note of the **Username** and **Password** fields under the **Shared Reservation** heading as highlighted above. You will need these values in the next steps.

2. Click the **Open your IBM Cloud environment** ![](_attachments/OpenOSWebConsole.png) button on the reservations detail page.

A new window or tab will open in your browser.

3. Enter the **Username** and **Password** for your OpenShift cluster (as described in step 1 above) and click the **Log in** button.

![](_attachments/OpenShiftLogin.png)

Before proceeding, verify that all {{tz_environment.numberOfWorkerNodes}} worker nodes were properly provisioned and available.

4. Click the **Compute** menu option in left-hand menu bar and then click the **Nodes** menu option.

![](_attachments/OpenShiftLeftHandMenu.png)

5. Observe the **Nodes** that have the role of **worker**.  There should be {{tz_environment.numberOfWorkerNodes}} of them with a status of **Ready**.

![](_attachments/OpenShiftThreeWorkerNodes.png)

!!! error "Are less than {{tz_environment.numberOfWorkerNodes}} worker nodes available and  **Ready****?"
    
    If there are less than {{tz_environment.numberOfWorkerNodes}} worker nodes in the **Ready** state, it is
    very likely you will encounter issues during the installation of {{offering.name}}. It is highly recommended to delete the current ITZ reservation and create a new one following the earlier instructions. Alternatively, you can open a ticket with the ITZ support team using the <a href="" target="_blank">#itz-techzone-support</a> slack channel and see if the support team can fix the broken node(s).

## Access the **Bastion** server for the ITZ environment

In the next steps, you will access a virtual machine running in IBM Cloud referred to as a **Bastion** server. This server will be used to run various IBM Cloud, OpenShift, and other command line interfaces to install {{offering.name}} on the OpenShift cluster. 

To access the **Bastion** server, you must create a remote shell from your local workstation to the **Bastion** using a secure shell protocol client (ssh). Most operating systems (MacOS, Linux, Microsoft Windows) have an ssh client built in. There are also 3rd party and open source clients like <a href="https://www.putty.org" target="_blank">putty</a> that can be utilized.

The screen images that follow utilize the native MacOS ssh client running from a terminal window. Specific instructions for other operating systems are not provided, but should be similar.

6. Copy the **Bastion SSH connection** string for your ITZ reservation details page.

![](_attachments/ITZReservationDetailsPage-Bastion.png)

At this time, make note of the **Bastion Password** field as highlighted above. You will need this password in the next step.

7. Open a terminal or command line window on your local workstation.
8. In your local terminal or command line window, paste the **Bastion SSH connection** string and press enter.

![](_attachments/BastionCLI-1.png)

9. If prompted to accept the fingerprint, enter **yes**

![](_attachments/BastionCLI-2.png)

10. Enter the **Bastion Password** when prompted for a password.

## Create install directory and retrieve the B2Bi installation scripts

11. Create a new directory for the B2Bi installation scripts.

```
mkdir b2bi
```

12. Set the **PROJECT_DIR** environment variable.

```
export PROJECT_DIR=$HOME/b2bi
```

13. Change directories to **PROJECT_DIR**.

```
cd $PROJECT_DIR
```

14. Download the B2Bi installation script.

```
wget -O {{b2bi.installScriptCloudShell}} {{gitRepo}}/{{b2bi.installPath}}/{{b2bi.installScriptCloudShell}}?raw=true
```

There should be 3 **pods** in the **b2bi** project. The **pods** will go through various states while starting up. Do not proceed to the next chapter until all 3 **pods** have a **Status** of **Running** AND the **Ready** column shows **1/1** for each **pod**! Note, it may take several minutes for the **sterling-fg-b2bi-asi-server-0** pod to change the **Ready** state from **0/1** to **1/1**. You may observe this **pod** restarting multiple times.  This is normal, just be patient.
