This use case will focus on assuring that the customer’s partner base remains current.  With PEM Standard, the sponsor can set up an interval where they will want to start a process to validate the contact information with their partners.

Like certificate updates, the partners will receive a notification without any interaction to kick off the process from the sponsor.  Like the certificate updates, the sponsor will be able to monitor the progress of their partners in updating their contact details through a self-service process that has been automated by PEM.  This view allows the sponsors to track the partner’s progress in case they need to intervene.
