The second use case will focus on setting up the certificate expiry parameters for partners and then moving a partner through the process to update their expiring certificate for which they have been alerted.  Once the parameters are set up, this allows PEM to start monitoring all of the sponsor’s partners for their expiring certificates so that a partner can update their certificate via a self-service process.
This allows the sponsor to rely on PEM to alert the partners of expiring certificates, removing the manual monitoring required to assure that certificates are always up to date.  PEM still provides a view for the sponsors into the partner’s progress in case they need to intervene.
