This demonstration guide assumes a **Custom ROKS** envirnment provisioned from IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/custom-roks-vmware-requests" target="_blank">here</a>.

At this point, all users should have completed the steps in the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan to reserve the Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud environment as described in the {{learningplan.name}} <a href="https://ibm.seismic.com/Link/Content/DC8JQcd2PWDTR8fB2FmjmV3cPC8P" target="_blank">Introduction video</a>. Before proceeding, validate that the reservation has been fully provisioned and is in the **Ready** state in ITZ. If not, please complete those steps before proceeding.

![](_attachments/TZReady.png)

The following steps must be performed before delivering the demonstration. These steps should be performed well in advance of starting an actual client demonstration as it will take approximately 90 minutes for all steps to complete.

## Accept invitation to join the ITZ IBM Cloud account for the Custom ROKS reservation

1. Open the **You are invited to join an account in IBM Cloud** email received from IBM Cloud and click the **Join now** link.

![](_attachments/JoinCloud.png)

2. In the browser window that opens, click the **Join Account** button.

![](_attachments/JoinAccount.png)

Follow the steps to login to IBM Cloud.

3. On the **IBM Cloud Dashboard** set the current account to **{{tz_environment.cloudAccount}}**.

![](_attachments/RightCloudAccount.png)

??? failure "Not seeing {{tz_environment.cloudAccount}}?"
    It is possible ITZ provisioned the OpenShift cluster in a different IBM Cloud account. Select the account specified in the ITZ reservation.
    ![](_attachments/OSITZReservation.png)

## Access the OpenShift web console

4. Click the **OpenShift** ![](_attachments/OpenShiftIcon.png) icon in the left-hand menu bar.

![](_attachments/CloudDashboardOpenShiftMenu.png)

5. Click **Clusters**.

![](_attachments/OpenShiftOverview.png)

6. Click the OpenShift cluster name in the table.

![](_attachments/OpenShiftClusters.png)

Note: the cluster name will be different than seen in the above image.

7. Click the **OpenShift web console** button.

![](_attachments/OpenShiftClusterOverview.png)

At this time, a page like the one below should open in a new browser window or tab.

![](_attachments/OSWebConsoleOverview.png)

Leave this browser window open. It will be used again later.

## Retrieve the B2Bi installation scripts

In this part of the demonstration, you will use the IBM Cloud Shell. If you are not familiar with IBM Cloud Shell, you can learn about it <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-shell?topic=cloud-shell-getting-started" target="_blank">here</a>.

!!! tip
    Use the **copy** capability of the demonstration guide to copy and paste commands to the IBM Cloud Command Shell to avoid typing errors.

8. In the IBM Cloud Portal, with the demonstration account selected (**{{tz_environment.cloudAccount}}**), click the IBM Cloud Shell icon.

![](_attachments/CloudShellMenu2.png)

The IBM Cloud Shell will open in a new browser tab or window. It may take a few seconds for the shell to initialize.

![](_attachments/CloudShell.png)

9. Create a new directory for the B2Bi installation scripts.

```
mkdir b2bi
```

10. Set the **PROJECT_DIR** environment variable.

```
export PROJECT_DIR=$HOME/b2bi
```

11. Change directories to **PROJECT_DIR**.

```
cd $PROJECT_DIR
```

12. Download the B2Bi installation script.

```
wget -O {{b2bi.installScriptCloudShell}} {{gitRepo}}/{{b2bi.installPath}}/{{b2bi.installScriptCloudShell}}?raw=true
```

    Now using project "db2" on server "https://c109-e.us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30720".

    You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

    to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname

## Update the environment variables with IBM container entitlement key and e-mail address

The next steps require editing of a file using the **vi** editor. If you are not familiar with the **vi** editor, it is strongly recommend to watch the following video before proceeding. There is no audio for this video.

![type:video](./_videos/EditENV-sh-final.mp4)

29. Open the **vi** editor.

```
vi  env.sh
```

30. Open the IBM **Entitlement key** page <a href="https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary" target="_blank">here</a>.

<!-- https://www.ibm.com/partnerworld/program/benefits/partner-package -->

Note, re-authentication to ibm.com may be required.

31. If an entitlement key does not already exist, click **Add new key**.
32. Click the **Copy** button.

33. Return to the IBM Cloud Shell window, use the arrow keys to move the cursor between the quotes in the **export APIKEY** line, press **i** to enter input mode, and paste the copied **entitlement key** between the quotes.
34. Press the **esc** key to exit input mode.
35. Arrow key down and over to between the quotes in the **export EMAIL=""** line and enter a your e-mail address.
36. Press the **esc** key to exit input mode.
37. Enter your e-mail address between the quotes on the **export EMAIL=""** line.

??? info "Learn an interesting detail about IBM Cloud Shell while you wait..."
    IBM Cloud Shell is a very useful tool when working with IBM Cloud command line interfaces as well as other Cloud-related tools like Red Hat OpenShift, kubernetes, helm, etc. as many of these tools are preinstalled and alleviate the need to install tools on personal workstations. However, IBM Cloud Shell has some limitations that you can read about <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-shell?topic=cloud-shell-issues-limitations" target="_blank">here</a>.

    One additional limitation not listed in the above doc is that IBM Cloud Shell will kill long running processes running in scripts (e.g. bash scripts). This issue was encountered while creating these installation scripts.  Originally, steps 37 through 39 above were contained in the deploy_b2bi.sh script. However, when executed, the deploy_b2bi.sh script would get killed (which in turn killed helm) after running approximately 20 minutes. By pulling the helm command out of the script and running it directly in the initial shell process, helm is able to complete the install of the B2Bi containers.

    NOTES:

    Please wait while the application is getting deployed.

    1. Run the below command to check the status of application server replica sets. At least 1 replica must be in 'READY' state.

         kubectl get replicasets -l release=sterling-fg -n b2bi

    2. Run the below command to check the status of the application server pods for the release.

        kubectl get pods -l release=sterling-fg -n b2bi -o wide

    To view the logs for a pod, run the below command.

        kubectl logs <pod name> -n b2bi

    3. Access the application by running the following url

That concludes the setup of the environment. Proceed to the next part of the demonstration guide to configure B2Bi.
