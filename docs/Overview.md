In this demonstration script, a secure partner-to-partner data exchange solution is created using IBM Sterling Business to Business Integrator (B2Bi). More specifically, this demonstration solution uses the IBM Certified Containers for IBM Sterling B2B Integrator version of B2Bi. This version provides enterprise-grade and security-rich product editions with integrated common software services for consistent-deployment lifecycle management, including easy install and configure options, management of upgrade and roll-back, scalability, and security.

This demonstration solution uses Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to allow two partners to exchange files in a secure manner.

To create this demonstration solution, the containerized version of B2Bi will be deployed to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (a fully managed OpenShift deployment). Learn more about Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift" target="_blank">here</a>.

This demonstration script consists of 3 installation and configuration chapters and a chapter describing a client demonstration scenario.

It is now time to install B2Bi on Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud (ROKS).
